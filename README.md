# Motion-signal-classification-competition

### Overview
Achieved third place among 48 groups (156 students) in the contest to train a model to distinguish between different types of motion recorded via smartphone sensors by applying supervised learning to five key machine learning models, utilizing preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and enhancing model accuracy with ensemble techniques and cross-validation.
